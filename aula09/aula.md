# Programação Reativa

Programação Funcional
On one side, functional programming is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.
On the other side, reactive programming is an asynchronous programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change.
Together, functional reactive programming forms a combination of functional and reactive techniques that can represent an elegant approach to event-driven programming – with values that change over time and where the consumer reacts to the data as it comes in.

## Reactive Manifesto

Responsive – systems should respond in a timely manner
Message Driven – systems should use async message-passing between components to ensure loose coupling
Elastic – systems should stay responsive under high load
Resilient – systems should stay responsive when some components fail
